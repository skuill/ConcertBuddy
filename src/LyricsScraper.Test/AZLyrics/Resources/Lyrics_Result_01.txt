I spoke a vow today
And asked if god would come and play
I've dug a shallow hole for him to sleep
But I swear he just won't answer me
I call on out is he afraid
I'll bury him down with the ones he keeps
And if the devil's listening
I'll come for him as well
If I suspect he had a hand to play
And if I see his face in town
There's room for two down underground
Nothing's gonna stop me 'til I'm done

Until I'm done!
Until I'm done!
Until I'm done!
Until I'm done!

Because tonight I'm killing gods!
Killing gods!

It's guilt and frustration, it's everything between
The silence and the absence hitting home
Peripheral glances and the chasing of a sound
I never knew I'd miss until it's gone
So ask me how I'm coping
And I'll smile and tell you "I'm just fine"
While down inside I'm drowning in the fucking rain

Because when everything is empty
And your heart is set to cave
Sometimes all you wish for
Is a place, is a place to place the blame

Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Damn you all
Because tonight I'm killing gods!

The incendiary shock wave, scorched earth policy
The devastation that only loss will leave
The chants and incantations of daily rituals
A subtle lapse in brutal honesty
So ask me how I'm coping
And I'll smile and tell you "I'm just fine"
While down inside I'm screaming 'til I fucking bleed

Because when everyone's expendable
And your heart can't take the wait
The last thing that you wish for
Is the face, is the face to face the pain

Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven
Flood your hell
Damn you all
Because tonight I'm killing gods

I spoke a vow today
And asked if god would come and play
'Cause I just want to cut that fucker down

Face me
Face me
Face me
Face me

Face me!
Face me!
None survive!
Face me!
Face me!
None survive!

None survive!

The devil and god have died inside me!
